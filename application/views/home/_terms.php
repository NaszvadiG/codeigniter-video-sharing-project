		<p class="title">Paid Accounts</p>
		Billing. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a "Paid Account"). We'll automatically bill you, after your free trial period, from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required to do so.
		<br><br>
		<span class="italic-font">No Refunds.</span> You may cancel your Videre Paid Account at any time but you won't be issued a refund unless it's legally required.
		<br><br>
		<span class="italic-font">Downgrades.</span> Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.
		<br><br>
		<span class="italic-font">Changes.</span> We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Termination</p>
		You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice.

We'll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Services "AS IS"</p>
		We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, VIDERE and LEAD LEARNER ASSOCIATES AND ANY AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states don't allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Limitation of Liability</p>
		TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL VIDERE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT VIDERE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO VIDERE FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some states don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Resolving Disputes</p>
		<span class="italic-font">Let's Try To Work Things Out First.</span> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Videre, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting info@leadlearner.org. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Videre may bring a formal proceeding.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">We Both Agree To Arbitrate.</span> You and Videre agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</span> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate (only within 30 days of agreeing to these Terms of Service) by contacting Videre at info@leadlearner.org.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">Arbitration Procedures.</span> The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in San Jose (CA), or any other location we agree to.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</span> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Videre will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</span> Either you or Videre may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Jose (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">No Class Actions.</span> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.
		<br><br>

		<span class="italic-font">Judicial forum for disputes.</span> In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Videre agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County (CA). Both you and Videre consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Controlling Law</p>
		These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.
		
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Entire Agreement</p>
		These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Videre with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
		Waiver, Severability & Assignment
		Videre’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Videre may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
		<br><br>
		<p class="title">Modifications</p>
		We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
